      <p> My favorite hobby is painting. I like painting because I can be creative with it. I can paint naything. I can paint a scenery, a flower, or abstract art. Painting is calming for me. I get to have fun with painting and experiment with it. I love all the different colors I can paint with as well. My favorite painting I have made is a sunset scenery. I did the background as a sunset with an ocean in the front view. Painting is a fun activity to do because you can be creative and maybe even learn something out of it. I definitely recommend it.
